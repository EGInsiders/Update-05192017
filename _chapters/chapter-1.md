I’ve invited everybody to join a <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/eginsiders">Google Group I started called EduGuide Insiders</a>. I’m not a big fan of Google groups, but I needed a way to get information out to everybody consistently, and a discussion group was the best way of doing that. I guess that even after Social Media has grown to be so popular, email is still the best means of communication.

I will also be posting information in the Google+ Community. I’ll announce testing assignments, but post the details on the Trello board. I hope to maintain a blog eventually, but for now that’s on hold. I’ll post on the Google+ community in the same way I might share information in a blog.

I can also be reached via email at <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>. I’m hoping that everyone will share questions and feedback via the Google Group or the Google+ community. I really see these as channels for two-way communication, and I hope that our testing process will be collaborative.
