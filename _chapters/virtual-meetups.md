I hope to begin hosting monthly video “Meetups” over Google Hangout. These meetings would last no more than an hour, and would be an opportunity for us to discuss the result of testing for a feature, and for me to explain the next testing assignment. I’d like to host this kind of meeting soon just to see what happens, but the very first one might be simply a meet-and-greet and a chance for me to discuss the plan for testing with everybody.
